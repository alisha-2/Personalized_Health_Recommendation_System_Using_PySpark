Developed a Personalized Health Recommendation System using PySpark to predict diagnoses from user symptoms, incorporating demographic data and symptom severity. Utilized the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm for collaborative filtering, achieving an RMSE of 0.8628. Designed a user-friendly Streamlit interface for inputting symptoms and visualizing top-5 diagnoses with tailored health advice. Leveraged PySpark for scalable data processing and integrated simulated APIs for dynamic recommendations, demonstrating expertise in machine learning, big data, and UI design.
